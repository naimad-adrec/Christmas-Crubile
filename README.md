# _Christmas Crubile_
##  🧑‍🤝‍🧑 [naimad-adrec](https://github.com/naimad-adrec) and [Munamused](https://github.com/Munamused) First Video Game Collab Project titled **_Christmas Crucible_**.
### Christmas Crucible is a 2D Sidescrolling Platformer where you play as a hardened **_Santa Clause_**, fighting his way through hordes of elfs that have been gone mad due to untold nightmares brought upon them by **_The Sandman_**. Santa will have to fight through these enemies in hopes of stopping **The Sandman**, who originally gave the elf's their nightmares, and relieve his little helpers of their perpetual state of frenzy. Can Santa accomplish this task in order to save Christmas? 🎅🎄

Our very first game, we are fresh and beginners so this is still very much a WORK IN PROGRESS and kind of an experiment to learn how unity works.
